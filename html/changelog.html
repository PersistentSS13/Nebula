			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Additional support has been instated for templates which are to be loaded multiple times. The main user-facing change is that when adding shuttle-restricted waypoints to an overmap object's initial_restricted_waypoints list, use the shuttle's type path, not its name. Templates that load ferry-type shuttles with waypoints not on the template will break with this system, but you can opt out by setting modify_tag_vars on the template datum to FALSE.</li>
