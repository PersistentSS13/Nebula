// The below should be used to define an item's w_class variable.
// Example: w_class = ITEM_SIZE_LARGE
// This allows the addition of future w_classes without needing to change every file.

/*
	A note on w_classes - this is an attempt to describe the w_classes currently in use
	with an attempt at providing examples of the kinds of things that fit each w_class

	1 - tiny items - things like screwdrivers and pens, sheets of paper
	2 - small items - things that can fit in a pocket
	3 - normal items
	4 - large items - the largest things you can fit in a backpack
	5 - bulky items - backpacks are this size, for reference
	6 - human sized objects
	10 - things that are large enough to not realistically fit into a container (or should not be contained)
	20 - things that take up an entire turf, like wall girders or door assemblies
