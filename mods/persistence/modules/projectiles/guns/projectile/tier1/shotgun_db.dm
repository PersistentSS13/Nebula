Somehow, this proved to be an immensely effective, powerful, and decidedly badass weapon. This model can be configured to fire one or both barrels at a time, and cannot be sawn off due to sporting reinforced barrels. It's often used by angry barkeeps and deranged space marines. Chambered in 12g shells."
