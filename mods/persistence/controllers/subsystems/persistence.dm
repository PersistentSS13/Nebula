/*
	#TODO: Save system overhaul:
	* Have saving sleeps/stoplag() every bunch of turfs, so connection to clients doesn't cut so easily.
	* Unify the sql serializer stuff, so it's less redundant. (We don't need 2 different serializer objects.)
	* Don't iterate the world 3 times over for no reasons. ( "for(var/atom/thing in somearea)" )
	* Don't access area's contents, behind the scene it just accesses world contents and is massively slow.
	* Don't concatenate strings more than once!! Use a list if you must, but just adding to a string is a hundred time slower
	  than just putting strings in a list and running jointext() on them.
	* Serialize turfs in chunks, and commit after each chunks so we have a coherent set of turfs to work with.
